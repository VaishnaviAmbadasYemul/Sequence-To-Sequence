# Sequence-To-Sequence

The goal of this project is to implement and evaluate sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) models with attention mechanism. We will train the models on a synthetic dataset where the target sequence is the reverse of the source sequence. The project aims to demonstrate the effectiveness of the attention mechanism in improving seq2seq model performance.

Approach

1. Generate a synthetic dataset where each source sequence is a random sequence of integers, and each target sequence is the reverse of the source sequence.
2. Implement the sequence-to-sequence model with attention mechanism in PyTorch.
3. Train the model on the synthetic dataset.
4. Evaluate the model performance using metrics such as loss and accuracy.
5. Plot the loss curves and other performance metrics for analysis.

Results

The expected outcomes of this project include:
- Loss curves for the seq2seq model with attention mechanism during training.
- Accuracy of the model in predicting the target sequences from the source sequences.
- Analysis of the effectiveness of the attention mechanism in improving seq2seq model performance.

Data Set:

The dataset used in this project is a synthetic dataset generated for the purpose of this project. Each source sequence is a random sequence of integers, and each target sequence is the reverse of the source sequence.

Data Set Explanation:

The synthetic dataset is chosen to provide a clear and simple example of the sequence-to-sequence modeling task. By reversing the source sequence to obtain the target sequence, we can easily evaluate the model's ability to learn the seq2seq mapping.
